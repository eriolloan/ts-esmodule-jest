# TS ESModule Jest

`ts-esmodule-jest` is a boilerplate for kickstarting ESM modules written in TypeScript. Jest and ts-jest are used for testing.

## Usage

- `npm run build` transpiles TS files found in `./src` to ES2020 JS in `./dist`.
- `npm run dev` executes transpiles to JS before running compiled files.
- `npm run test` executes tests. It will not fail if no tests are written.


Collocation of tests is prefered.
